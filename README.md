# Sales Analysis Project

This project analyzes product sales data using Python and Jupyter Notebook. It provides insights into sales performance, revenue, and product trends using a CSV file (`productSales.csv`).

## Features
- Reads and displays sales data from a CSV file
- Calculates total units sold per product
- Computes daily and monthly total revenue
- Identifies top and least selling products
- Finds the most and least expensive products
- Determines highest and lowest sales dates
- Visualizes daily revenue, daily sales, and total sales using bar charts

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- pandas
- matplotlib

## Usage
1. Place `productSales.csv` in the project directory.
2. Open `SalesAnalysis.ipynb.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or VS Code.
3. Run the notebook cells sequentially to perform the analysis and view the results.

## File Descriptions
- `SalesAnalysis.ipynb.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the analysis code and visualizations.
- `productSales.csv`: CSV file with sales data (must include columns like `ProductName`, `UnitsSold`, `Date`, `TotalRevenue`, `UnitPrice`).

## Visualizations
- Bar charts for daily revenue, daily sales, and total sales by product.

## Author
This project was created as part of a Python internship assignment for sales data analysis.
